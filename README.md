It has been quite a challenging project while developing the SoleMate app. It gave me exposure to modern tools and technologies for building up an intuitive mobile platform that would be one of the most simple and easy shoe shopping experience. One can browse through a huge amount of varieties in shoes, find deals, and maintain the wishlist under one shelter in this shopping app.

How AI helped me with the development of SoleMate: In development for SoleMate, I utilised AI tools such as Chat GPT to streamline the process, add on to the functionality of the app itself, and even optimise my work. Using AI allowed me to quickly prototype features and efficient code for my app.

What is SoleMate doing?

The SoleMate app is intended to be an all-inclusive shopping solution for customers.
The users can view the categories of shoes, the details and prices of the products, its image, and conveniently make the purchase.
SoleMate highlights the best of deals available, whereby users can realize that there is sales on everything, from the popular Air Force 1 to other styles, and it would be rather easy to get a good bargain.
Users can add shoes to their wishlist and manage it easily.
The application includes authentication, such that a user can create an account and log in.
The application has an easy navigation system that includes the Main Screen, Menu Screen, Wishlist Screen, Log in Screen and so on. Each of these screens has a button to go back to the main screen.
The application uses Firebase for user authentication and real-time database storage to handle data.
